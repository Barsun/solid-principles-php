##Five agile principles that should guide you every time you write code.

####(Examples are written in PHP)

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

####Examples:

####**SRP	The Single Responsibility Principle**
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

Let's say that we have a Modem class encapsulating the concept of a modem and its functionalities.

````
class Modem
{
    public function dial($pno)
    {
        // Implementing dial($pno) method.
    }

    public function hangup()
    {
        //  Implementing hangup() method.
    }

    public function send($c)
    {
        // Implementing send($c) method.
    }

    public function receive()
    {
        // Implementing receive() method.
    }
}
````

We can foud here that this class has 2 responsabilties:
First is data chanel and second connection

Mixing business logic with presentation is bad because it is against the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Take a look at the following code:
````
interface DataChannel
{

    public function send($c);

    public function receive();

}

interface Connection
{

    public function dial($pno);

    public function hangup();
}

class ModemImplementation implements DataChannel, Connection
{

    public function send($c)
    {
        // Implementing send() method.
    }

    public function receive()
    {
        // Implementing receive() method.
    }

    public function dial($pno)
    {
        // Implementing dial() method.
    }

    public function hangup()
    {
        // Implementing hangup() method.
    }
}
````

Even this very basic example shows how separating presentation from business logic, and respecting SRP, gives great advantages in our design's flexibility.

####**OCP	The Open Closed Principle**
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

At first thought that might sound quite academic and abstract. What it means though is that we should strive to write code that doesnâ€™t have to be changed every time the requirements change.

####**LSP	The Liskov Substitution Principle**
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

####**ISP	The Interface Segregation Principle**
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

####**DIP	The Dependency Inversion Principle**
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
